    <div class="about-container">
        <p class="about-text"> Bonzzard is a multipurpose Linux server, at first hand was made for Minecraft hosting, but we found very useful tools within it, like programming through SSH, use of GCC, hosting of Discord bots, or other game servers, and now a fully functional portfolio with administration tools, like Minecraft RCON server, and its own RPG API.
            We have 2 PC Servers working at once, but we plan to expland to a huge server / data center for server hosting, and a gaming center for the public. With the focus on our upcoming new MMORPG game for Discord.
